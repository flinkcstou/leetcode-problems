- **capacity** - The capacity refers to the total number of elements that an array or collection can hold
- **length** - The length refers to the number of elements an array currently holds or the size of the array.
- **index** - refers to the position of an element within the array.
- **binary array** - двоичный массив

- **capacity** - capacity == array.length // Yup, it's a bit confusing that you need to access the capacity of an Array
  by using .length. Unfortunately, this is just something you'll need to get used to.
- **length** - you'll need to keep track of yourself. Length did not give in program.

- **capacity/length** is a number of items, not a highest index. Start of 1.
- **index** - the first element of the array has an index of 0. Start of 0.
